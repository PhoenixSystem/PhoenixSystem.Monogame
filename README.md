# PhoenixSystem.Monogame
## Monogame plugin for Phoenix System

The Monogame plugin includes some basic re-usable systems, components, and aspects that are useful when using Phoenix System to develop a game on top of Monogame.

Currently the following systems are provided:

* Camera (2d) with parrallax support
* LerpColorSystem for textures/text from one color/alpha to another
* MovementSystem for moving stuff.
* SpriteAnimationSystem for animating sprites
* SpriteBatchRenderSystem for rendering sprites

There's also a basic implementation of SpriteSheet and animation loading leveraging common tools such as Texture Packer from codeandweb.
